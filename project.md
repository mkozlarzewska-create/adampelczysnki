Design a one-page static website for a squash coach. The style should be modern, professional yet dynamic, minimalist, and use a color palette of bottle green and white for high contrast. The layout should feel fast-paced and sporty, with strong typography and diagonal UI elements reflecting the speed of the game.
Layout Structure:
Header: logo, sticky navigation menu (About me, Offer, Contact).
Hero component: Large headline with a large photo, subtitle, and a call-to-action button (Contact me).
About me: short, engaging text about Adam, Short bio highlighting certifications and unique coaching style (e.g., 'Focusing on biomechanics and mental toughness').
Offer: 3-features icons: 1-on-1 Coaching, Group Clinics, Junior Development with short description below.
Contact: A simple contact section with fields for name, email, and phone number.
Footer: Social media links.
Ensure the design is responsive, looks great on mobile, and uses a clean serif font for headings and sans-serif for body text. 
Interactivity: I want scrolling effects, button hover effects, parallax if possible.
